# mithril.observer.js

Get feedback on what [DOM mutations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) occurred during each Mithril draw loop

Simply include after Mithril or import instead of Mithril in a CommonJS project with `mithril` as a registered dependency to get logs of the DOM mutations Mithril makes to the document.

[Check out this demo](https://jsfiddle.net/barney/jpwL5v6v/) for a wired up example of an 'observed' Mithril app.
